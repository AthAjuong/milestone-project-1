# TightCore Gym
## Code Institute: Milestone Project 1


TightCore Gym is a fictional gym that offers guidance to clients wanting to improve their body composition. This project idea was offered by Code Institute as part of their softare development program. As a person with keen interests in sports, health, and lifestyle, I thought it would be interesting to create a project reflecting a business that helps people stay active and healthy. 

This was the first of the milestone projects that make up Code Institute's Full-Stack Software Development Course as of Feb. 2021.
