# TightCore Gym
## Code Institute: Milestone Project 1

![Example of website across devices](assets/readme-files/responsive.png)

TightCore Gym is a fictional gym that offers guidance to clients wanting to improve their health, fitness, or body composition. This project idea was offered by Code Institute as part of their softare development program. As a person with keen interests in sports, health, and lifestyle, I thought it would be interesting to create a project reflecting a business that helps people stay active and healthy. 

This was the first of the milestone projects that make up Code Institute's Full-Stack Software Development Course as of Feb. 2021.
This static website is required to be responsive and comprises of pages developed with HTML5 and CSS3.

## Website Development Considerations
To develop this website and address the interests of the sample buyer personas mentioned above, the developer spoke with various individuals. This was so the developer could gauge the functions and features that real-life customers would look for in a gym website. That information would inform the developer on how best to target the new/potential customers and current customers for "TightCore Gym".

### Strategy of website
This website is made for three key overarching segments.

1. Customer Type:
   1. Current gym customers
   2. New/Potential gym customers

2. Demographic:
   1. Age range: Under-55
   2. Male customers
   3. Female customers

3. Psychographic:
   1. Interests:
      * Health & lifestyle
      * Exercise
      * Sports
      * Bodybuilding or body composition
      * Weight loss

   2. Lifestyle:
      * Active 
      * Outgoing
      * Social

* Find the gym on their platform of choice - phone, tablet, social media channels, etc.

Considering the outline of this strategy and the goals mentioned above, the developer created a strategy table to determine the importance and viability of the outlined website goals.

### Scope of website

A website scope was determined in order to deliver on the goals targeted in the website's strategy. The idea was to align the website's features with the intended purposes of the website. The features of the website fall into two categories, namely content and functionality.

#### Content requirements:
A user visiting the TightCore Gym website will look for:
* Information on gym facilities - equipment, pool, steam room, etc.
* Services offered - exercise classes, instructors, nutrition advice
* Contact and location details
* Transparency: information about the gym and its staff
* Social links
* Deals and promotions

#### Functionality requirements:
A user visiting the TightCore Gym website will be able to:
* Navigate the website effortlessly
* Browse the website on different platforms
* Find information about the services offered
* Contact the gym directly from the website
* Be able to find external social proofs by visiting social media links

### Structure of website
The information hierarchy of this website was outlined with considerations taken from the strategy and scope of the site. A sample sitemap was created in Adobe Photoshop and will be used to inform the content and functionality requirements of the website.

### Skeleton of website
The developer created wireframe mockups in a ![Figma Workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/tWD50wf2MlbyRV5sjfmvcS/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1). The intention was to design a sample website that kept user experience in mind while reflecting the strategy, scope, and structure of the website.

Home page:

Contact page:
![contact-wireframe](assets/readme-files/contact-tightcore-gym.png)

## Features

This project has five different pages. A user can navigate between each page by clicking on the links in the regular or toggle navigation bar.

### Consistent design:
* The developer has kept the logo on the top, left-hand side of all pages so that there is consistent branding. 
* Navigation bar varius between toggle and full width but styles are uniform across both.
* Consistent footer design across all pages and all page sizes.

#### Home Page:
* From the home page, it is clear to see that this website is a gym.
* Hero image has an overlay to ensure the text and call-to-action are both visible for any user.
* Designed "Trustpilot"-themed stars to give some social proof. Four stars placed under the button, to convince users that the gym is legitimate and trustworthy.
* The home page also offers reasons as to why the user should either become a member or sample TightCore's services.
* Users can get in touch with the gym directly from the landing page using the button in the hero image.
* Users can navigate to appropriate content about classes, gym trainers and the gym facilities using links in the content section.
* Two panels provide sample images of people training and tell the customers about the facilities and classes on offer. They can follow links to learn more.
* Customers can show their intent to sign up for membership by following a button that leads them to contact the gym. They learn the benefits of membership here.

#### About Us Page:
* The about us page offers an insight into the motivation and values of the company.
* The about us page then provides pictures and bios of the staff members that work at the company.

#### Classes Page:
* This page offers an idea of the types of classes the gym offers.
* A YouTube video was embedded using iframe. Users can get a sense of what it is like to take part in gym activities.

#### Gym Page
* The gym page offers an idea of the type of equipment held in TightCore. 
* Another call-to-action nudging customers to sign up.

#### Contact Page
* The contact page is a simple one with a form. 
* A hero image is placed as the header with a contact form overlaying on desktop.
* On other devices, the form is placed below the hero image.

## Features to Add
* The website would be more functional with a direct communications line to the customers. It is not currently viable, but chatbots would improve customer wait times.
* After learning further technologies, the developer could add a blog section where customers could learn about food, exercise, and healthy living.
* With new technologies, the developer could add a gated portal for current members. Members would get premium content and even more attention.

These features currently go beyond the scope of the first project but can be toyed with in the near future.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5 - The language used to create the skeleton of the website. Forms, buttons, sections, divisions, etc.
* CSS3 - The language used to style the HTML5 pages and elements. 
* [Bootsrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The developer used the bootstrap framework to structure the website's layouts more easily. This was beneficial when developing for mobile and mobile devices first.

* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/tWD50wf2MlbyRV5sjfmvcS/Untitled?node-id=78%3A42) - Here is a link to my Figma workspace. This was used to draft and realise the ideas behind the design of the website. 

* [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com/) - I relied on Unsplash.com for images as they are royalty free and also high-quality. A perfect location to source images for a website.

* [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - The developer used this website to compress all of his images. This was intended to lower page load times and improve user experience.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Is where the developer selected the "Noto Sans KR" font after perusing Googles font library for something suitable.

* [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - The developer often browsed the website when code would go awry. There is a lot of guidance on Stack and it improves the understanding of different tag functions.

* [W3C Schools](https://w3schools.com) - This website is very informative. The developer would often consult W3Schools and constantly revisit various tags of code.

## Testing
The developer tested the website across different browsers and according to the functions they were intended to achieve.

### Validating the HTML and CSS:

#### HTML Validation
The developer used [W3C's HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check his pages for any validation errors. The [TightCore Gym](https://athajuong.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html) website passed the HTML validation with no errors.

#### CSS Validation
The developer used [W3's Jigsaw CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) to check his css for any validation errors and the website passed with no errors.

#### Lighthouse Validation

![Lighthouse Validation](assets/readme-files/lighthouse.png)

##### Content Requirements
The developer believes this website can fulfill its intended content requirements.

The website does help customers find information on:
* Information on gym facilities - equipment.
* Services offered - exercise classes, instructors.
* Contact and location details
* Transparency: information about the gym and its staff
* Social links

##### Functionality Requirements

The developer believes this website can fulfill its intended functionality requirements.

The website enables customers to:
* Navigate the website effortlessly
* Browse the website on different platforms
* Find information about the services offered
* Contact the gym directly from the website
* Be able to find external social proofs by visiting social media links

### Testing Browsers
The developer manually tested the website across 3 separate browsers. Namely:

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Microsoft Edge

### Testing Responsive Design
The developer manually tested the website's responsive design using Google's Developer Tools. The website is responsive across multiple devices. 

It should be noted that the developer did not choose to make the website responsive for devices below a maximum width of 370px.

* Google developer tools - allows you to check responsiveness across multiple devices.
* Collected feedback from different friends and family members.

### Issues Discovered
Initially the developer wanted to use a fixed navigation bar, he found that it left spaces behind and above it. Rather than using a fixed navigation bar, the developer opted for a navigation bar that remained in its position.

The developer wanted to use the contact form to gather data on customers but without a server or knowledge on servers, he could not. Instead, the contact form remains as an example of what it could achieve rather than a true solution.

The devloper had challenges organising the layout for the gym page. Having panels with content side-by-side and removing them at certain screen sizes. The developer reused his own code from the home page's panels and filled in the blanks.
